# Installing Angular CLI & walkthrough

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

If using mac, you may need to use `sudo` at the start

If you are within a office/corporate environment, you may need admin rights to do the same.
Reach out to the Tech support or raise a request to have temporary admin access.

#### To create an angular application

```
ng new my-app-name
```

Once the installation is done, run the app by the command `ng serve` and the application will be
up and running in port 4200 by default.

In terminal

Open the browser under this url

```
http://localhost:4200/
```

The home page will look something like this. It may change depending on when you see this though.

If you open the "View Page Source", it should look something like this

![view page source](/images/page-source.png)

which if you wonder, doesnt look like the screenshot you saw as the landing page.
This is what SPA does. The initial load just bring in this much only, and th whole application is rendered within `<app-root></app-root>` tag which you see above. See the explanation of the same in the next section.

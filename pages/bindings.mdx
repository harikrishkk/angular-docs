# Types of Bindings in Angular

We have 4 types of bindings (ðŸ“š)

By binding, we mean, a connection or a communication between template & class or business logic.

- String interpolation. ( if we have any expression that can result in a string, use this )
- Property binding (HTML element attributes / properties like alt, src, href , etc can be bound dynamically)
- Event Binding ( click, keyboard events, mouseevents )
- 2 Way binding

#### Note:

- String interpolation and property binding is from the class to the template. ie, (one way binding).
- Event binding is when user interacts with template which updates the class . (This is also one way binding, but opposite direction )
- Two way binding is, as the name suggests , bi-directional ( also called Banana in a box )

Our class file ( other details omitted , check the stackblitz code for full code)

```js
export class BannerComponent {
  options = {
    heading: 'Welcome',
    description: '',
    imageURL: 'https://picsum.photos/200/300',
    imageAlt: 'dummy image',
  };

  accept() {
    console.log(this.options.description);
  }
  cancel() {
    console.log('cancelled');
  }
}
```

and our template

```js

<img
  class="d-block mx-auto mb-4"
  [src]="options.imageURL"   /* ðŸ‘ˆ property binding */
  [alt]="options.imageAlt"
  width="100"
  height="100"
/>

/* ðŸ‘‡ String interpolation */
<h1 class="display-5 fw-bold">{{ options.heading }}</h1>

/* ðŸ‘‡ Property binding to innerHTML */
<p [innerHTML]="options.heading"></p>

<button
  (click)="accept()" /* ðŸ‘ˆ event binding */
  type="button"
  class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 gap-3"
>
  Accept
</button>

/*  ðŸ‘‡ 2 way binding  */
<textarea [(ngModel)]="options.description"></textarea>
```

#### Stackblitz

<iframe
  width="100%"
  height="500"
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-6ckg5o?file=src/app/banner/banner.component.ts"
></iframe>

#### Code explanation

Here, we forked the first example and made changes on top of that.

- We made it dynamic.
- We added some properties in the class file, and bound them to template.
- We interacted with the Call to action button and updated the class
- we made 2 way binding using a built in `[(ngModel)]` syntax.
- Note: To get this feature, make sure, we need to register the `FormsModule` which we have imported from respective namespaces.
- like this:

```js
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@NgModule({
  imports: [FormsModule],
})
```

- by registering the same within `imports:[]` array, we unlock all the features provided by the forms module.
- we also made the button dynamically disabled using the property binding

```
[disabled]="!options.description"
```

- so whenever the description is empty, the Accept button is disabled.

### Another option for [(ngModel)] ðŸ“š

[Example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-2ysqax?file=src/app/banner/banner.component.html)

- The only difference is that, we bind to the `input` event of textarea
- `$event` is a reserved keyword that passes the whole event object into the handler method

```js
<div class="text-center">
  <div>Type in the description here:</div>
  <textarea (input)="handleInput($event)"></textarea> /* ðŸ‘ˆ this needs to be $event itself */
</div>
```

and in the class file

```
handleInput(event) {
    this.options.description = event.target.value;
}
```

so every time, we type in a new character, it is kept in sync by assigning the target value to the object's description property.

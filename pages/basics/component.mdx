### How is the application getting bootstrapped? ( ðŸ“š )

> Angular.json is the heart of the application

In angular.json, look at this portion

```js
"root": "",
"sourceRoot": "src", // ðŸ‘ˆ means, the application source is within this folder
"prefix": "app", // ðŸ‘ˆ means, the components will be prefixed with this word (app-root, app-header etc)
"architect": {
        "build": {
          "options": {
            "index": "src/index.html", // ðŸ‘ˆ the only HTML sent across from server
            "main": "src/main.ts", // ðŸ‘ˆ the first file compiler should look for.
            "assets": [
              "src/favicon.ico",
              "src/assets"
            ],
            "styles": [
              "src/styles.scss" // ðŸ‘ˆ  custom styles which are imported dynamically in head as a link tag
            ],
            "scripts": [] // ðŸ‘ˆ  extra javascript to be dynamically injected as a script tag
```

within the index.html, we have a placeholder

```html
<body>
  <app-root></app-root>
</body>
```

within this placeholder, whatever the `main` points to, which is `src/main.ts`

the `main.ts` contains

```js
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic()
  .bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

This basically says, `platformBrowserDynamic` is a module that helps us take our application which is wrapped within the AppModule to loaded into browser. This step is done via `platformBrowserDynamic` and not directly injected into DOM like a jquery or javascript using `document.querySelector` or anything. That is because we need to make the application loosely coupled so that it can be plugged into browser as well as non browser environments. ( like Ionic which is used for building native mobile apps ). For such situation, instead of `platformBrowserDynamic`, we use the mobile equivalent method `platformNativeScriptDynamic` so that the bootstrapping is done right and there is no direct DOM dependency. We need our application to work on all environments ( browser, server, web worker, mobile device etc ).

An angular application should contain **atleast one module and within that one component** ( With Angular 15, we have stand alone components which omits the use of modules though - More on that later )

An `AppModule` looks like this.

```js
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent], // ðŸ‘ˆ register components, pipes, directives here
  imports: [BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule], // ðŸ‘ˆ other modules are registered here
  providers: [], // ðŸ‘ˆ services are registered here
  bootstrap: [AppComponent], // ðŸ‘ˆ root component of the application
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Note: `providers: []` is not as simple as it is, i will have a dedicated section for it later.

Here, we see something called a `@NgModule` which is a decorator.

This is a typescript concept.
A class can be decorated with various decorators. Here since its decorated with `@NgModule` we are asking the angular compiler to identify the class as a Module and we also pass some configuration into it.

The `bootstrap` property points to the root component which is `AppComponent` ( Note that this is not css bootstrap and has nothing to do with it. Don't get confused. This basically means glue the component to the module as the first component in the tree )

Basically, our application is a bunch of components nested within one another and represents more or less like a tree, for which, we need a root, and that root is `AppComponent`

if you remove the `AppComponent` from the `bootstrap` property, keep the array empty and see the browser, we see it empty. Check the console and see thoe error

```js
ERROR Error: NG0403: The module AppModule was bootstrapped, but it does not declare "@NgModule.bootstrap" components nor a "ngDoBootstrap" method. Please define one of these.
```

basically, the error scremes that the root component is missing.

#### What is a component

if you open up `app.component.ts`

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'test';
}
```

we see something similar to what we have seen before. A class, but this time decorated with `@Component`

That informs angular that, please consider this class as a component. We will use this component with the custom tag of `<app-root></app-root>` ( in index.html)

Every component will be having 3 things

- Template logic ( within HTML)
- Business logic ( within the class file , ie `.ts` file)
- Styling ( within the `.css / .scss` file)

The style that is mentioned in the css will be `scoped` to that component by default. ( More on that later)

A variation of the component can be like this with **inline template & inline styles**

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `<h1>Hello</h1>`,
  styles: [
    `
      * {
        color: red;
      }
    `,
  ],
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'test';
}
```

which one to choose is a personal choice.
You will see people advocating for both. So i take no stands, but show you that such an option is there & is upto you to choose the variation. From angular's perspective, there is no advantage of using one over the other.
The one point that we can argue is that, if we use the array syntax for styles, then we can have multiple style files tacked on if we wish.

```js
styleUrls: ['style1.scss', 'style2.scss'],
```

The above is not common, but possible. This may need additional webpack configuration tweaks.

A selector can be an element, an attribute, a class but not a ID

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-header', //by element
  selector: '[app-header]', // by attribute
  selector: '.app-header', // by class
  templateUrl: './header.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
})

```

**Note:** just because we created a component doesn't mean angular will magically recognize them.
For that, we need to register them within the module inside the `declarations` array

```js
@NgModule({
  declarations: [  AppComponent ], ðŸ‘ˆ
```

the `.spec` file is for unit testing purpose.
